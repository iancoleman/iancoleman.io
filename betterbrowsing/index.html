<h1>Better Browsing</h1>

<p>These simple things will improve your experience on the web.</p>

<h2>Main priority</h2>

<p>
These are things I always install and notice immediately if they aren't.
</p>

<p>
They don't require any behaviour change and work seamlessly in the background.
</p>

<h3>Ublock Origin</h3>

<p>Block ads in your browser.</p>

<p>
Ublock Origin is available as a
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm" target="_blank">

</a>
</p>
<p>
or
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/" target="_blank">

</a>
</p>

<h3>Undistracted / Unhook</h3>

<p>Remove recommendations on youtube (great for kids)</p>

    desktop chrome browser extension
</a>
</p>

<h2>Second priority</h2>

<p>These are nice to have but may require minor changes in the way you use the internet.</p>

<h3>Firefox on mobile</h3>

<p>
Firefox on mobile allows installing extensions to block ads etc, which chrome
can't do.
</p>

<p>
Firefox is available for
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=en_US" target="_blank">
    android
</a>
or
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926" target="_blank">
    iOS
</a>
</p>

<h3>Newpipe mobile youtube app</h3>

<p>
Watch youtube on mobile devices without ads or distractions.
</p>

<p>
Firefox browser on mobile with addons is a simpler alternative.
</p>

<p>
Install
<a href="https://newpipe.net/" target="_blank">
    newpipe
</a>

<h3>Youtube download</h3>

<p>
Downloaded videos don't have ads, but it means you can't just click the link
in your browser to watch them, you have to leave the browser to download the
video and watch the downloaded file.
</p>
<p>
This tool can download any video, but not all videos are legal to download due
to copyright, so please be aware of the rules in your country and the
particular site or video you're using.
</p>
<p>
This tool works with many sites other than youtube, and is often simpler than
creating yet-another-account on a random video website to watch tv.
</p>
<p>
Install
<a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#readme" target="_blank">
    yt-dlp
</a>
for the command line.
<a href="https://stacher.io/" target="_blank">
    Stacher
</a>
looks like a good GUI for it but I haven't used it.
</p>

<h2>Technically interesting but difficult to use</h2>

<p>
These are projects I find technically very interesting but don't use
because they aren't easy enough for non-technical users to interact with.
</p>

<h3>Pi-hole</h3>

<p>
Pi-hole blocks ads and trackers before they get to your computer by acting
as a middle-man between your router and your computer.
</p>

<p>
The nice thing is it can block ads for every device on your network without
needing to install anything on those devices.
</p>

<p>
The hard thing is it can make websites not work properly and making them work
is not usually easy for most people to work out.
</p>

<h3>Magic Wormhole</h3>

<p>
Easily send files directly from one computer to another.
</p>

<p>
This avoids the need to upload to a server like dropbox or google
drive.
</p>

<p>
But it requires you to keep the application open while the recipient downloads
the file, which may not always be immediate.
</p>

<p>
Install
<a href="https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole?tab=readme-ov-file#magic-wormhole" target="_blank">
    Magic Wormhole
</a>
for the command line, or
<a href="https://github.com/Jacalz/rymdport?tab=readme-ov-file#rymdport" target="_blank">
    Rymdport
</a>
for a graphical interface.
